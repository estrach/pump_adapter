CAD model for a pump adapter attaching a [Decathlon ITIWIT pump](https://www.decathlon.co.uk/p/double-action-canoe-kayak-hand-pump-low-pressure-0-10-psi/_/R-p-325027) to a [Decathlon Ultim Comfort mattress](https://www.decathlon.co.uk/p/us-self-inflating-camping-mattress-ultim-comfort-70-cm-1-person/_/R-p-307396).  The model is build in FreeCAD.  Measurements for the model were taken from these two items.  

## Disclaimer

This is not something I've seen for sale, but something that I would find very useful.  I've not yet printed the model or evaluated its performance.  Watch this space for more details.
